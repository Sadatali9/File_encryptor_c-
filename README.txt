#Encryption/Decryption Program README

**Overview**

This program is a simple command-line tool that allows you to encrypt and decrypt text files using a Caesar cipher. The program uses a shift value to shift each letter in the plaintext by a certain number of positions in the alphabet.

**Features**

* Encrypts and decrypts text files
* Supports Caesar cipher algorithm
* Command-line interface for easy usage

**Usage**

To use the program, simply run it from the command line and follow the prompts:

1. `python encrypt.py` - This will start the encryption process.
2. Enter the path to the text file you want to encrypt or decrypt.
3. Enter the shift value (a number between 1 and 25) to specify the encryption or decryption key.
4. Enter `e` to encrypt or `d` to decrypt.
5. The program will prompt you to enter the password for encryption (optional).
6. The encrypted or decrypted text will be saved to a new file with a `.encrypted` or `.decrypted` extension.

**Example**

```
$ python encrypt.py
Enter file path: example.txt
Enter shift value: 3
Enter e to encrypt or d to decrypt: e
Enter password (optional): [your_password]
Encrypted file saved as example.txt.encrypted
```

**Decryption**

To decrypt a file, simply run the program again and enter the path to the encrypted file, followed by the shift value and `d`.

```
$ python encrypt.py
Enter file path: example.txt.encrypted
Enter shift value: 3
Enter e to encrypt or d to decrypt: d
Decrypted file saved as example.txt.decrypted
```

**Note**

* The program uses a simple Caesar cipher algorithm, which is not secure for sensitive data.
* The program does not store any passwords securely; if you enter a password, it will be stored in plain text.
* The program is designed for educational purposes only and should not be used for sensitive data.
